# In Door Face Mask Inspector (IDFMI) 
## Description
### 1. Overview
This is a project that aims to allow the return of working environment in indoor offices.

It focuses on reading live streams for ip cameras in enterprise environment,
after that, it applies a face mask detection model using the state-of-art Artificial Neural Networks.

In addition to detection, it also provides a customization platform for surveillence cameras.

Another service provided from the system is alerting security members via email. 
### 2. Project Architecture
The project consists of 3 containers

```bash
idfmi: Contains the Flask application and gunicorn application server

## Requirements
### 1. Docker
Since the project is containerized, then the only important dependency is to have docker and docker compose installed, installation guides are as follows:
- Docker Desktop for Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/ 
- Docker Desktop for Mac OS: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/
- Docker Engine for linux: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
- Docker-Compose for linux: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Notice that for Windows and Mac you should only install docker desktop, which will download docker engine and docker-compose by default.
### 2. Microsoft Azure Subscription 
This is a requirement for the demo only to simulate the working environment with respect to authentication, authorization, and Secrets.

You can check microsoft's documentation on how to make a project with azure active directory and keyvault.

- Azure Active Directory: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/#documentation

- Azure KeyVault: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/#documentation

## Installation
- clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/othmanKisha/In-Door-Face-Mask-Inspector.git
    ```   
## Usage
- after cloning the repo, go to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd In-Door-Face-Mask-Inspector
    ```
- run docker-compose command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
- now you can view the website by typing `localhost` on the browser.
